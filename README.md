# Anxiety Manager

## Project Description

Anxiety Manager is a web app intended to aid users in introspecting about their every day anxieties. Using user input I plan to quantify and graph out their daily patterns of anxiety. The hope is that by doing this, the user will see patterns about themselves and their anxieties in a readable and understandable way so that they might change their thought patterns.
